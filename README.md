## **Appendix B - Group Log**</p>
***

To produce this document we formed a team of 6 members to spread out and interview key
figures in the department. This includes teachers (mainly focused on programming and
database teachers), registrar head and finally the Department head.
<br><br>
We then had to set up a meeting to compile and organize all the interview recordings and notes
to select out all the functional and nonfunctional requirements.
After a lengthy process of selecting and agreeing on the contents and features to be included
we headed to Google Docs and created a document to be shared with the team so everyone
can read, work and evaluate the document simultaneously.
<br><br>
Finally we all gathered up for the editing and finishing work and finished working on this
document.
