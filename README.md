# **3 Specific Requirements**

## **3.1 External Interface Requirements**


### **3.1.1 User Interfaces**
* The website should work and be tested against Firefox and Google Chrome.
* The website should be responsive on different devices
### **3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces**
* There are no special hardware interface requirements.
### **3.1.3 Software Interfaces**
* Software requirements of the system are very nominal and no other special requirement
is there hence it is economically feasible.
## **3.2 Functional Requirements**
#### **●  Administrative access for the department head**
  The department head will have a special login page where he has special credentials to
  login which enables him to have administrative access to the entire platform. Which
includes resetting passwords of any account, direct access to the front page
announcements and administrative access to the database.
#### **● Account registration for students and staff**
Every user will use the institutional email or ID to login to the website. The website will
fetch the full name from the institutional email and use it as a username.
#### **● Announcement page of the departement**
The department will be able to announce events,seminars ,schedules or any major news
.This will solve the hurdle of information inaccessibility for the department and its staff.
#### **● Give a tour of the software department facilities**
The website will have a section where students or staff members see all the available
resources, facilities and offices available to them inside the department. Supported with
high quality photographs, users will view the labs and resources available clearly.

to its objectives and it’s approach to reach these objectives and it’s future position in the
university and for the students will be included.
#### **● Display the location of the department and it’s facilities**
Since AASTU is very wide, it's pretty easy to get lost. And even after years of exploring
it’s wide compound you may not know where certain buildings and offices are. So the
website will provide the locations of these important offices and facilities in a clear
manner.
#### **● Resource sharing page**
In this page ,the course materials and recommended suggestions for the entire batch will
be listed (Written source, Audio-visual aids, e-learning/technology, Objects, Events, and
People etc) that can be used to support or help Teaching and Learning.
#### **● Course plan and schedule for all batches throughout their academic years**
Most students are curious to find out what they’ll learn the semesters and years ahead.
So we’ll provide a page where all the subjects that will be taught throughout the 5 years
of software engineering. This will include the names of subjects, resources they’ll use,
credit hours and so on.
#### **● Question and Answer forum for the students with the staff**
Due to communication gaps both staff and students suffer to communicate.This page will
give a platform for the staff and students to directly be in touch thereby eliminating any
miscommunication or hurdles.
#### **● There will be a page specifically tailored to every use case(Admin, Staff, and Students)**
#### **Admin page**

* The department head is the sole user of this page. It will enable the admin to grant or
revoke access to other users.

## **Appendix B - Group Log**
***
To produce this document we formed a team of 6 members to spread out and interview key
figures in the department. This includes teachers (mainly focused on programming and
database teachers), registrar head and finally the Department head.
We then had to set up a meeting to compile and organize all the interview recordings and notes
to select out all the functional and nonfunctional requirements.
After a lengthy process of selecting and agreeing on the contents and features to be included
we headed to Google Docs and created a document to be shared with the team so everyone
can read, work and evaluate the document simultaneously.
Finally we all gathered up for the editing and finishing work and finished working on this
document.
